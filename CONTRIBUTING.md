# First things first
Thank you soo much for contributing to this project! :+1::tada:
We really really appreciate any help building the estim8 project.

# What should I know before I get started?
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. Nothing fancy, we just don't have a whole lot roadmap documented yet, so it's just easier to discuss this with you up front.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Do you have a code standard to follow?
Probably, but we haven't written it down anywhere yet. When we do, we would definitely put something in there about good test coverage and keeping documentation up to date.
