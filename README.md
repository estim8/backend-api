This documentation (and the Wiki) is work in progress. Hopefully, it won't be that long until it's in a stable state :sweat_smile:

# A free online estimation game for agile teams

Estim8 is a free online platform for agile delivery teams to estimate work in an easy and fun way.

![Sample UI](doc/img/sample-ui-cards-shown.png?s=400)

The above is, by the way, a mock-up at the moment ;-)

Read more about our vision and see some more nice mockups in the [Wiki](https://github.com/estim8/backend-api/wiki/Vision)

## Helping distributed teams

Running estimation sessions with distributed colleagues is hard (or at least a lot harder than it has to be!). With Estim8 we try to create a modern, nice-looking and free tool to easy setup estimation sessions with colleagues across the globe.

# Navigating this repo

This repository contains the API component for the Estim8 product. The web front project is hosted in a [separate repo](https://github.com/estim8/web-frontend).

The repo is organized in these folders:
- `/src` is where the source code and solution files goes
- `/tst` is where tests are written
- `/doc` is for documentation and supporting files

You can read more about the overall architecture [here](https://github.com/estim8/backend-api/wiki/Architecture).
